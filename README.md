⚠️ This project is part of my **backend learning journey** before transitioning my focus to **Data Analytics**.

It demonstrates solid foundations in **API design, business logic structuring and clean architecture principles**, which I now leverage in data-related projects.

---

## 📌 Overview

Study project built with **Django REST Framework** to practice a layered architecture using:

- Repository Pattern  
- Command Pattern  
- Separation of concerns  

The API manages **notes and comments**, including soft delete, restore operations and nested resources.

---

## Features

- Notes CRUD
- Comments nested under notes
- Soft delete for notes and comments
- Restore endpoints
- Cascade soft delete (deleting a note also soft deletes its comments)
- Repository pattern
- Command layer for business actions
- Domain result enums for command outcomes

### Responsibilities

**Models**
- Define database structure.

**Repositories**
- Encapsulate database access.

**Commands**
- Implement business actions and rules.

**Domain**
- Define result enums used by commands.

**API**
- Expose endpoints via Django REST Framework.

## Main Endpoints

### Notes
```http
POST /api/notess/
GET /api/notess/
GET /api/notess/{id}/
PUT /api/notess/{id}/
DELETE /api/notess/{id}/
POST /api/notess/{id}/restore/
```

### Comments
```http
GET /api/notess/{note_id}/comments/
POST /api/notess/{note_id}/comments/
PUT /api/comments/{id}/
DELETE /api/comments/{id}/
POST /api/comments/{id}/restore/
```
---

## Example Response

GET /api/notess/

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "First note",
    "content": "Example content",
    "deleted": false,
    "created_at": "2026-03-10T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-03-10T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Business Rules

- Notes and comments support **soft delete**.
- Deleted notes cannot receive new comments.
- Deleting a note **soft deletes its related comments**.
- Comments cannot be modified if their parent note is deleted.
- Restore operations re-enable previously deleted records.

## Purpose

This project was created as part of a backend learning path to practice:

- REST API design
- Django ORM
- Layered architecture
- Business rule isolation
- Clean code structure

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Separation of concerns improves scalability and readability
- Business logic should not live in views
- Structured architecture simplifies testing and maintenance
